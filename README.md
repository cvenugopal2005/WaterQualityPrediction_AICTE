# Water Quality Prediction

This project aims to predict multiple water quality parameters using machine learning techniques, specifically `MultiOutputRegressor` wrapped around a `RandomForestRegressor`. It was developed as part of a one-month AICTE Virtual Internship sponsored by Shell in June 2025.

## Overview

Access to clean water is a critical global concern. Accurate prediction of various water quality metrics can help in early detection of pollution and ensure timely intervention.

In this project, we:
- Collected and preprocessed real-world water quality datasets  
- Used supervised machine learning for multi-target regression  
- Built a pipeline using `MultiOutputRegressor` with `RandomForestRegressor`  
- Evaluated the model using appropriate regression metrics

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.12**  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** – Data handling  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning model and evaluation  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive experimentation

## Predicted Water Quality Parameters

The model predicts multiple water quality parameters such as:

- NH4  
- BOD5 (BSK5)  
- Colloids  
- O₂, NO₃, NO₂, SO₄, PO₄  
- Cl⁻

## Model Performance

The model was evaluated using:

- **R² Score**  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

Performance was acceptable across all parameters.
